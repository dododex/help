A **torpor timer** for ARK: Survival Evolved can be used to track a creature's **Torpor** over time to know how long you have until it wakes up and how many narcotics you'll need to feed it to max out its torpor.

## How To Use a Torpor Timer 
1.  Once you've knocked out a creature, simply open its inventory to **view its Torpor stat**. 
2.  **Enter that stat into the timer** and start the timer. Dododex is now synced with your creature. 
3.  When you use narcotics in the game, tap the narcotics buttons on the torpor timer so that it stays synced.

  
_(Note that in-game lag can sometimes cause the timer to fall slightly out of sync, however, if you notice a significant discrepancy with Dododex's rate, please report it below.)_
