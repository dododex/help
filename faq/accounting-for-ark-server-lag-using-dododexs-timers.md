title: Accounting for Ark Server Lag Using Dododex's Timers
category: using-dododex

> Unfortunately, server lag on multiplayer on Ark: Survival Evolved can cause Dododex's timers to get slightly out of sync.

While this issue shouldn't be apparent for most creatures, the larger ones, higher level ones, or ones with high food/torpor rates, may be more apparent over time.   
  
Use timers with caution when you notice any server lag.

It is recommended to occasionally “re-syncing” Dododex with your dino. You can do this by pausing Dododex for several seconds until it matches up with the dino’s food or torpor.
