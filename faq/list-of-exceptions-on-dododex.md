title: List of Creature Capability Exceptions on Dododex
category: using-dododex
---

Dododex lists each creature's capabilities (whether it can be carried, damage certain structures, snared by traps, etc.) as a "**yes**" or a "**no**," however, there are some rare exceptions for specific creatures in specific scenarios. 
In the future, Dododex may include disclaimers in the app for these rare cases, but for now, here's a list of the exceptions:

## List of Exceptions

**Managarmr**
- Gateways: Fits through Tek Gateway
- Gateways: Fits through Metal Gateway *without* door
- Gateways: Does not fit through stone gateway

**Raptor**
* Fits through single doorframe if there is no wall on top.
* Only fits through double doorframe if two doorframes are stacked (with or without door).


## List of Exceptions (ARK Mobile)

ARK Mobile differs slightly from the PC/console game, however, this will likely change when ARK Mobile aligns with the PC/console game in the future.

In some cases, these differences are not labeled in Dododex due to technical restrictions of the app. This is a list of those restrictions.

* **ARK Mobile's default multipliers are different.** For a full list of multipliers, see: [Configuring ARK Multipliers on Dododex]("/en/article/configuring-ark-multipliers-on-dododex")
*   **Flyer stamina is higher on ARK Mobile.** Flying creatures have an increased stamina stat in comparison to the PC/console version of the game. Dododex's stat calculator will not calculate stamina accurately for these creatures.

### Carrying Differences

The following creatures **cannot be carried by the Argentavis** in ARK Mobile (but can on PC/console):

*   **Baryonyx**
*   **Gallimimu**
*   **Kaprosuchus**
*   **Procoptodon** 
*   **Dimetrodon** (CONFIRMATION NEEDED)
