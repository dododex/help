=================================================

Dododex lists each creature's capabilities (whether it can be carried, damage certain structures, snared by traps, etc.) as a "yes" or a "no," however, there are some rare exceptions for specific creatures in specific scenarios.

In the future, Dododex may include disclaimers in the app for these rare cases, but for now, here's a list of the exceptions:
