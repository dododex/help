title: Wiki Spawn Maps Not Loading Properly
category: bugs
---

> **Dododex is not affiliated with Fandom, the company that runs ARK's [previous] official wiki.** The spawn maps are simply webpages that open within the Dododex app.

Currently, there's a known bug where Fandom's spawn maps are not loading properly. Fandom has been dropping support for many interactive functions of the ARK wiki and many other gaming wikis. This has caused some issues with their wikis loading on their mobile site (including the site that opens from the Dododex app).

ARK recently dropped Fandom as their official Wiki provider. In a future update, Dododex will switch to ARK's new official wiki.

In the meantime, please open the new official wiki's spawn maps in your phone's browser:Â <https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/Data_maps>
