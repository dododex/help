In ARK: Survival Evolved, wild creatures spawn at random levels. Upon taming, they gain **bonus levels** based on the taming effectiveness and their wild level. After taming, they can be leveled.

What is Taming Effectiveness?
-----------------------------

**Taming effectiveness** determines how many bonus levels a creature will gain upon taming in ARK: Survival Evolved. Each time a creature eats during taming, its taming effectiveness decreases slightly. Less effective items — such as raw meat or berries — will make its taming effectiveness decrease faster. Taming effectiveness decreases on a logarithmic scale, meaning the lower the effectiveness, the less it will decrease (your creature's first feeding may decrease effectiveness by 1%, and then next may decrease by 0.98%, etc). 

How many levels does a creature gain upon taming?
-------------------------------------------------

A creature can gain a maximum of **half of its current wild level**. The number of levels it gains is determined by its final taming effectiveness. 

A creature with 80% taming effectiveness will gain 80% of half of its wild levels. 

**For example:**

* A level **100** creature is tamed with **80% effectiveness**.
* Half of its wild levels (100) = **50**
* 80% of 50 = **40**
* Creature gains 40 levels and becomes **level 140** upon taming. 

It's also important to note that this the bonus levels are **rounded down**. If a level 100 creature gains 40.9 levels, it will actually just gain 40 levels. 

Since a creature needs to eat at least once to be tamed, the taming effectiveness will never be exactly 100%. This means that the maximum level a creature can gain upon taming on official servers is **74**. (Half of 150 is 75, but since a creature will eat once, it will be just under 100% taming effectiveness, which will round down to 74.) 

How many levels can a creature gain AFTER taming?
-------------------------------------------------

Creatures can gain 88 levels after taming.
