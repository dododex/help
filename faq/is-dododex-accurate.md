title: Is Dododex Accurate?
category: using-dododex
---

**Dododex is committed to accuracy** and its data is updated and improved many times a week!Â Since Dododex is used by tens of thousands of players daily, the data is constantly checked and verified and errors are typically quickly reported and fixed.

Since there's so much data, so many dinos, and combinations of foods and weapons and multipliers across different platforms, it's of course possible that you can run into an error. ARK also sometimes will release an unannounced change. But when this happens, please report it using the button on the bottom of the page and I'll look into it! It's sometimes super easy to fix.
