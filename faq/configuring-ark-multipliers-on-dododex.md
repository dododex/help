This guide will show you how to configure your ARK multipliers for various types of servers and game modes. This guide only covers multipliers that affect taming, breeding, and XP rates on Dododex.

### Official Server Evolution Event Weekends

On both the app and [Dododex.com](https://www.dododex.com/), you must manually update your multipliers during Evolution Event weekends. In the Dododex app, you can use the "Evolution Event" preset (or create your own) to easily switch back and forth. Small Tribes, Conquest, and Arkpocalypse servers are all affected by Evolution event rates ([confirmed by developers](https://twitter.com/Jatheish/status/1332108397576138753)), however, the multiplier is not always the same as "2x (or 3x) the normal rate." See ARK's official announcement for each event's multipliers on these server types.

**IMPORTANT:** ARK's Evolution Events don't always the same multipliers. Be sure to check Dododex's live-updating [**Official ARK Server Rates**](https://www.dododex.com/rates)  to confirm the current multipliers on official servers.


## Single Player

_By default, single player on PC and console has "Use Single Player Settings" on. See below for details about Use Single Player Settings._

### ARK: Survival Ascended's Difficulty Presets
ARK: Survival Ascended has difficulty presets that simply select multipliers for you, as seen in the table above. If you want to set everything to 1, click "Restore Defaults." Note that while the "Easy" difficulty increases Taming Speed (dinos require a lower amount of food), it also decreases Food Drain (dinos take longer to get hungry), meaning that overall time required to tame does not necessarily go down. In some cases, Easy takes longer to tame, and in some cases it will be the same, depending on the dino, level, and food. Also note that a longer tame time means more narcotics.

<em>* In your game settings, all multipliers will display as "1" and these can be customized if you purchase the ARK Pass. However, these are ADDITIONAL multipliers on top of the base multpliers listed above. If you increase your taming multiplier to 2, for example, it will be 2x the base multiplier (2 x 2.5 = 5). So you would use 5.</em>

Single player is not affected by event boosts on ARK Mobile.

## Tribe Tower Bonus
In Bob's Tall Tales, the Tribe Tower gives you a taming bonus. You can easily add a Tibe Tower taming bonus to your taming multiplier by using this formula:

<b>Multiplier + Taming Speed Bonus</b>

So if your multiplier is 2.5, and your Tribe Tower Taming Speed Bonus is 2%, your new multiplier would be 2.55:

<b>2.5 + 2% = 2.55</b>

### What is "Use Single Player Settings"?

The "Use Single Player Settings" option in the Dododex app should be enabled if you have this setting enabled in your ARK settings (under "General"). This setting is defaulted _**on**_ in single player in ARK and it increases all of your multipliers:  

* Taming Speed: **2.5×**
* XP Multiplier: **2×**
* Egg Hatch Speed: **10×**
* Baby Mature Speed: **36.799×**
  
(This multiplier is _on top of_ your existing multiplier. For example, if you have your taming multiplier in ARK set to "2" and you have "Use Single Player Settings" on, your multiplier will actually be 5.)   
 
ARK Mobile players should keep this setting off, as it is not available in ARK Mobile.


## Notes

* **Egg Hatch Speed, Baby Mature Speed, and XP Multiplier** are only available on the Dododex App (not yet available on dododex.com) 
* **Dino Character Food Drain** should always be set to 1 unless you're on an Unofficial Server with custom settings (this is uncommon), or single player with this setting changed.
* **Harvesting Speed** multipliers do not apply to Dododex.
* **Permanent 2x Taming (August 2020)**: In August 2020, ARK's base taming speed on PC, PS4, and Xbox was doubled, meaning 1× is as fast as what 2× was previously. Dododex has been updated to reflect this. Like ARK, Dododex implemented this as part of the base speed (1x) -- so keep your multipliers at 1x on Official Servers.


## If all of Dododex's calculations seem wrong...

If all of Dododex's calculations are too low or too high, your multipliers are most likely set up incorrectly. Another common error is if you have "**Use Single Player Settings**" enabled in the app when it's not enabled in the game (or vice versa). This setting will increase all of your multipliers.
