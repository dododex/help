Dododex now allows you to use the app offline!

Dododex's images are stored remotely, which allows me to add and update them without requiring an app store update.

> **IMPORTANT:** To use Dododex offline, it is recommended to connect to Wifi at least once. Once you've connected to Wifi, the app will download all of the images and content so that they can be displayed even when you're not connected to the internet.

## Some features may not be available offline

Some features, such as player tips, the ARK Wiki spawn maps, the [ARK Mobile Kibble chart](http://www.dododex.com/kibble) are only available while online.
